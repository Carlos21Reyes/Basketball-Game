# Basketball Game

Players compete to reach 30 points first. Left and right movement is done using keys A and D, and players shoot by clicking on the left mouse button while pointing at the desired angle at the intended power on the power bar.

Created with Pygame and the physics engine is built using SciPy's ODE solver. Run the main.py file to play (i.e. python main.py). Enjoy!
