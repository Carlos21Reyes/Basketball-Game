# Basketball Game

Players compete to reach 30 points first. Left and right movement is done using keys A and D, and players shoot by clicking on the left mouse button while pointing at the desired angle at the intended power on the power bar.

For the Android version, tilt the phone to move left and right and flick the screen to shoot. The power and angle of the shot is decided by the speed and angle of the flick.

Created with Pygame and the physics engine is built using SciPy's ODE solver. Run the main.py file to play (i.e. python main.py). Ported to Android with LibGDX and Box2D. APK file can be found in android/build/outputs/apk. Enjoy!
