Players compete to reach 30 points first. Left and right movement is done using keys A and D, and players shoot by clicking on the left mouse button while pointing at the desired angle at the intended power on the power bar.

For the Android version, left and right is done by tilting the phone , and the power and angle of the shot is decided by the speed and angle of the flick respectively.
